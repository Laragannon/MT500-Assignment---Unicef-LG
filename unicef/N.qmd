## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#. check working directory
# getwd
# import .csv file to Global Enviroment
birthsunder2.5 <- read.csv("unicef_indicator_1 (1).csv", header = TRUE, sep = "," )
antenatalcare <- read.csv("unicef_indicator_2 (1).csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
metadata <- read.csv("unicef_metadata.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
library(ggplot2)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(rnaturalearthdata)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
```

```{r}
# Births under 2.5kg by country
births_by_country <- birthsunder2.5 %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(total_births = sum(obs_value))
# Get world map data
world_map <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")
# Join the birth data from uniced to the world map data and plot
merged_data <- world_map %>%
  left_join(births_by_country, by = c("sovereignt" = "country"))
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = merged_data, aes(fill = total_births), color = "white") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red") +
  labs(title = "Births under 2500g by country") +
  theme_void()
births_by_country <- birthsunder2.5%>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(total_births = sum(obs_value)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_births)) 
top_10 <- head(births_by_country, 10) 
print(top_10)
```

```{r}

```

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
